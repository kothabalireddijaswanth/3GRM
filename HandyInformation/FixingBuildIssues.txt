Problem 1:
	warning: implicit declaration of function ‘exit’ [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
     exit(0);
     ^~~~
     
Solution 1:
	ImplimentationOfStack.c:37:5: warning: incompatible implicit declaration of built-in function ‘exit’
	ImplimentationOfStack.c:37:5: note: include ‘<stdlib.h>’ or provide a declaration of ‘exit’

 Problem 2:    
     
	ImplimentationOfStack.c:41:10: error: expected expression before ‘)’ token
	return();
          ^
	ImplimentationOfStack.c:41:9: warning: ‘return’ with a value, in function returning void
	return();
         ^
	ImplimentationOfStack.c:12:6: note: declared here
	void main()

Solution 2:return 0;           int main()


Probelm 3:

	ImplimentationOfStack.c: In function ‘push’:
	ImplimentationOfStack.c:47:6: error: ‘top’ undeclared (first use in this function); did you mean ‘pop’?
	  if( top==SIZE-1)
		  ^~~
		  pop
	ImplimentationOfStack.c:47:6: note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in
	ImplimentationOfStack.c: In function ‘pop’:
	ImplimentationOfStack.c:61:5: error: ‘top’ undeclared (first use in this function); did you mean ‘pop’?
	  if(top==-1)
		 ^~~
		 pop
	ImplimentationOfStack.c: In function ‘display’:
	ImplimentationOfStack.c:73:6: error: ‘top’ undeclared (first use in this function); did you mean ‘pop’?
	  if( top == -1)
		  ^~~
		  pop


Solution 3: == is used for comparession , = is used for intilizing
